DATA TUTORIALS

DASHBOARD 1: HOME

KPI'S Requirement

1.Total Number of Calls: We need to track and display the total number of calls received by our call center over a specified period.

2. Total Call Duration in Hours: It is crucial to understand the total amount of time our call center staff spends on calls in hours, which can help us in resource allocation and capacity planning.

3. Total Call Duration in Minutes: Similar to the total call duration in hours, this KPI provides the total call time but in minutes, offering a more granular view of call durations.

4.Average Call Duration in Minutes: To assess the efficiency of our agents, we need to calculate and display the average call duration in minutes. This metric can help identify trends in call handling.

5.Response Time Percentage: Response time is a critical factor in customer satisfaction. This KPI should display the percentage of calls answered within a predefined time frame, helping us gauge our ability to provide prompt service.

* Chart's Requirement

6. Total Call by Day (Column Chart): Display a column chart that shows the total number of calls on each day over a specified time period.

7. Total Calls by State (Filled Map Chart): Create a filled map chart that visualizes the total number of calls received from different states or regions.

8. Top Reason for Calls (Tree Map): Implement a tree map chart to display the top reasons for calls. Each box in the tree map represents a call reason.

9. Total Calls by Channel (Donut Chart): Create a donut chart to showcase the distribution of calls by different communication channels.

10. Total Calls by Sentiment (Column Chart): Utilize a column chart to illustrate the distribution of calls by sentiment (e.g., positive, negative, neutral).

11. Total Calls by Call Centre (Bar Chart): Create a bar chart that presents the total number of calls handled by each call center or department.
